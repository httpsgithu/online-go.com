            Hello!
            <p>
                Thank you for registering an account with online-go.com. Unfortunately, there has
                been a problem with your VPN in recent days.
            </p>
            <p>
                Due to abuse linked with your VPN, the VPN has been temporarily disabled, and the
                user registration will not be completed. We are currently working to obtain logs
                from the VPN company to isolate the abuse and re-enable use of this VPN. You can
                help speed up this process by letting us know what VPN service you are using:
            </p>
            <p className="collect">
                <input
                    value={vpn}
                    placeholder={"VPN Provider name"}
                    onChange={(ev) => setVPN(ev.target.value)}
                />
                <button onClick={submit}>Submit</button>
            </p>
            <p>Thank you in advance for your cooperation in helping us resolve this issue.</p>
            <p>
